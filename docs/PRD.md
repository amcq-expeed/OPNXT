# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Title: Feature Voting Web App
Generated: 2025-09-16T09:31:44-04:00

## Overview
A simple web application where users can propose features and upvote them. The goal is to validate demand and prioritize the roadmap.

## Goals & Success Metrics
- MVP in 2 weeks; public beta in 1 month.
- KPIs:
  - Number of submitted features
  - Daily vote activity
  - Week-1 retention

## Stakeholders & Users
- Stakeholders: PM, small dev team, early adopters.
- Users: Visitors who can propose and vote on features.

## Scope (MVP)
- Create feature (title only)
- Upvote feature
- List features sorted by votes
- Delete feature (admin)

Out of Scope (MVP)
- Authentication
- Persistent storage (can be added later)
- Analytics dashboard

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast page loads (<1s perceived)
- No PII storage in MVP
- Simple in-memory data store

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Python-based stack (Streamlit UI; optional FastAPI backend later)
- Future DB integration possible (SQLite/Postgres)

## Release Plan
- Internal MVP: end of Week 2
- Public beta: end of Month 1

## Risks
- Lack of authentication may allow spam (mitigated by manual moderation)
- In-memory store loses data on restart (acceptable for MVP demos)
