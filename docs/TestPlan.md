## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
Define the objectives, resources, and processes for testing the product.

### 1.2 Scope
Summary for Testing:
- Unit tests for business rules; smoke tests for web app endpoints (where applicable).
- No external QA env needed; use local run and CI.

## 2. Test Items
- Features under test:
- MVP features: create feature, upvote, list sorted by votes, delete feature (admin).
- Non-functional: fast page load (<1s), no PII, persistence not required in MVP.
- KPI: number of submitted features, vote activity per day, retention week-1.

## 3. Features to be Tested
- As listed above; prioritized based on MVP and risk.

## 4. Features Not to Be Tested
- TBD

## 5. Approach
- Strategy (unit/integration/e2e): Unit tests for business rules; smoke tests for web app endpoints (where applicable).
- Environments / Test Data: No external QA env needed; use local run and CI.

## 6. Pass/Fail Criteria
- Acceptance Criteria derived per feature in SRS.

## 7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
- TBD

## 8. Test Deliverables
- Test cases, results, defect reports, coverage reports.

## 9. Testing Tasks
- TBD

## 10. Responsibilities
- Team roles: Agile, 1 dev + 1 reviewer. Prioritize MVP features first.

## 11. Schedule
- Aligned with project timeline: Timeline: MVP in 2 weeks, public beta in 1 month.

## 12. Risks and Contingencies
- TBD
