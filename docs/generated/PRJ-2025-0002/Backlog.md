#### Features
- Feature 1.1: Basic HTML Page Creation

##### User Stories
- **User Story 1.1.1**: As a user, I want to access the HTML page so that I can see the message displayed.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given I have internet access, when I navigate to the HTML page, then I should see the message "Hello World!" displayed.
    - Given I do not have internet access, when I try to access the HTML page, then I should not be able to view the message.
    - Given I access the HTML page, when the page loads, then it should load within 2 seconds on standard internet connections.
    - Given I access the HTML page, when I view it on a common web browser, then it should be displayed correctly without errors.

## Assumptions & Open Questions
- Users will have basic internet access to view the HTML page.
- What specific web server or platform will be used for hosting?
- Are there any additional functionalities required for the page?
