# Backlog for Agentic SDLC Automation Project

## Epics
### Epic 1: JIRA Monitoring
- **Feature 1.1:** Board Monitoring
  - **User Story 1.1.1:** As a Development Team member, I want the system to continuously monitor specified JIRA boards so that I can be alerted of new items.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a JIRA board, when a new item is added, then the system detects the item within 5 minutes.
      - Given multiple items, when they are added, then the system prioritizes them based on configurable rules.
      - Given a monitored item, when it is updated, then the system tracks the changes.
      - Given the system is running, when a new item is detected, then it triggers the appropriate workflow.

### Epic 2: Requirements Analysis
- **Feature 2.1:** Completeness Check
  - **User Story 2.1.1:** As a QA Engineer, I want the system to analyze new items against the standard template so that I can ensure completeness.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a new item, when analyzed, then the system identifies missing required fields.
      - Given an item, when evaluated, then the system scores its clarity and specificity.
      - Given a set of requirements, when analyzed, then the system provides a completeness score.
      - Given an incomplete requirement, when clarification is needed, then the system formulates specific questions.

### Epic 3: Story Generation
- **Feature 3.1:** Template Application
  - **User Story 3.1.1:** As a Product Manager, I want the system to apply the standard story template to create structured stories so that I can maintain consistency.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a requirement, when the story template is applied, then the system populates all required fields.
      - Given a generated story, when it is created, then the system assigns a unique identifier.
      - Given a story, when linked to a requirement, then the system maintains traceability.
      - Given a story, when decomposed, then the system generates appropriate tasks.

### Epic 4: Testing Framework
- **Feature 4.1:** Test Generation
  - **User Story 4.1.1:** As a QA Engineer, I want the system to create automated tests based on acceptance criteria so that I can ensure quality.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given acceptance criteria, when tests are generated, then the system links them to the corresponding stories.
      - Given a story, when tests are created, then the system estimates test coverage.
      - Given a set of tests, when executed, then the system captures and analyzes results.
      - Given a test failure, when reported, then the system generates a detailed failure report.

### Epic 5: User Acceptance Testing
- **Feature 5.1:** UAT Coordination
  - **User Story 5.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want the system to manage the UAT process for completed items so that I can ensure stakeholder satisfaction.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given an item ready for UAT, when notified, then stakeholders receive alerts.
      - Given UAT feedback, when captured, then the system categorizes it by type and severity.
      - Given feedback, when analyzed, then the system routes it to appropriate teams.
      - Given feedback resolution, when verified, then the system tracks implementation.

### Epic 6: Release Management
- **Feature 6.1:** Release Planning
  - **User Story 6.1.1:** As a System Administrator, I want the system to track items eligible for release so that I can manage deployments effectively.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given items ready for release, when grouped, then the system generates release notes.
      - Given a release schedule, when items are coordinated, then the system tracks their status.
      - Given dependencies, when identified, then the system notifies stakeholders of potential impacts.
      - Given a release, when completed, then the system captures release metrics.

## Definitions of Ready and Done
- **Definition of Ready:** User stories must have clear acceptance criteria, be estimated, and prioritized.
- **Definition of Done:** User stories are implemented, tested, and accepted by stakeholders.
