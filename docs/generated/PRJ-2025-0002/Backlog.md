# Backlog for Agentic SDLC Automation Project

## Epics
### Epic 1: JIRA Monitoring
- **Feature 1.1:** Board Monitoring
  - **User Story 1.1.1:** As a Development Team member, I want the system to continuously monitor specified JIRA boards so that I can be alerted to new tasks.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a JIRA board, when a new item is added to the "To Do" column, then the system detects it within 5 minutes.
      - Given a new item, when the system detects it, then it identifies the project context of the item.
      - Given multiple items, when they are added, then the system tracks changes to monitored items concurrently.
      - Given a backlog of items, when the system processes them, then it prioritizes based on configurable rules.

### Epic 2: Requirements Analysis
- **Feature 2.1:** Completeness Check
  - **User Story 2.1.1:** As a Product Manager, I want the system to analyze new items against the standard template so that I can ensure all required fields are filled.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a new requirement, when the system analyzes it, then it identifies any missing required fields.
      - Given a requirement, when the system evaluates it, then it scores the requirement based on completeness metrics.
      - Given an incomplete requirement, when the system identifies it, then it generates specific questions for clarification.
      - Given a requirement, when the system communicates with requestors, then it tracks outstanding clarification requests.

### Epic 3: Story Generation
- **Feature 3.1:** Template Application
  - **User Story 3.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want the system to create structured stories using a standard template so that I can maintain consistency across projects.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a requirement, when the system applies the standard story template, then it populates all fields correctly.
      - Given a story, when it is created, then the system generates a unique identifier for it.
      - Given a story, when it is linked to a requirement, then the traceability is maintained.
      - Given multiple stories, when they are generated, then they are organized into epics appropriately.

### Epic 4: Testing Framework
- **Feature 4.1:** Test Generation
  - **User Story 4.1.1:** As a QA Engineer, I want the system to create automated tests based on acceptance criteria so that I can ensure thorough testing of features.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given a user story, when the system generates tests, then it creates unit, integration, and system test templates.
      - Given a test, when it is linked to a story, then the system tracks the test coverage.
      - Given a high-risk area, when identified, then the system suggests additional testing.
      - Given a test execution, when it is completed, then the system captures and analyzes the results.

### Epic 5: User Acceptance Testing
- **Feature 5.1:** UAT Coordination
  - **User Story 5.1.1:** As a Business Requestor, I want the system to manage the UAT process so that I can provide feedback on completed items.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given completed items, when they are ready for UAT, then the system notifies appropriate stakeholders.
      - Given UAT feedback, when it is captured, then the system categorizes it by type and severity.
      - Given feedback, when it is analyzed, then the system routes it to the appropriate teams.
      - Given feedback resolution, when it is verified, then the system tracks the implementation.

### Epic 6: Release Management
- **Feature 6.1:** Release Planning
  - **User Story 6.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want the system to track items eligible for release so that I can ensure timely delivery of features.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given eligible items, when they are grouped, then the system generates release notes from completed items.
      - Given a release schedule, when it is created, then the system coordinates with deployment systems.
      - Given a release status, when it is tracked, then the system notifies stakeholders of release activities.
      - Given release metrics, when they are captured, then the system provides insights into release performance.

## Definitions of Ready and Done
- **Definition of Ready (DoR):** User stories must have clear acceptance criteria, be estimated, and have all dependencies identified.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** User stories are considered done when they are fully implemented, tested, and accepted by the Product Owner.
