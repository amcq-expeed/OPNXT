# Software Design Document (SDD)

**Project Name:** Agentic SDLC Automation Project  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-29  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Approval:** [Approval Status]

## 1. Architecture Overview  
The Agentic SDLC Automation Project will utilize a supervisor-agent architecture where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of the software development lifecycle under the coordination of a supervisor agent. This architecture allows for modularity and scalability, ensuring efficient processing of tasks.

## 2. Modules/Components  
### 2.1 JIRA Monitoring Module  
- Monitors JIRA boards for new items.  
- Triggers workflows based on detected events.

### 2.2 Requirements Analysis Module  
- Analyzes requirements for completeness and clarity.  
- Manages clarification requests and responses.

### 2.3 Story Generation Module  
- Generates stories and tasks based on requirements.  
- Maintains traceability between requirements and generated items.

### 2.4 Testing Framework Module  
- Creates and executes automated tests.  
- Manages test environments and tracks execution history.

### 2.5 UAT Coordination Module  
- Manages the UAT process and captures feedback.  
- Coordinates with stakeholders for UAT readiness.

### 2.6 Release Management Module  
- Plans and coordinates releases.  
- Generates release notes and tracks release status.

## 3. Data Model  
The data model will include entities for requirements, stories, tasks, tests, and feedback. Each entity will have attributes relevant to its function, ensuring comprehensive tracking and management throughout the SDLC.

## 4. Integration Points  
- **JIRA API:** For monitoring and managing JIRA items.  
- **Testing Frameworks:** For executing and managing tests.  
- **Version Control Systems:** For associating code changes with stories.

## 5. Error Handling  
The system will implement error handling mechanisms to log errors, notify administrators, and provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting. Graceful degradation will be ensured to maintain system integrity during failures.

## 6. Security  
The system will enforce role-based access control, integrate with organizational authentication systems, and maintain comprehensive audit logs to track user interactions and automated actions.

## 7. Deployment  
The system will be deployed in the organizational cloud environment, supporting containerized deployment and automated deployment processes.
