**Project Name:** Agentic SDLC Automation Project  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Approval:** [Approver Name]  

## 1. Test Objectives  
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the Agentic SDLC Automation Project meets its functional and non-functional requirements as outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

## 2. Scope  
### 2.1 In-Scope  
- Functional testing of JIRA monitoring and event detection.  
- Requirements analysis and story generation functionalities.  
- Automated test generation and execution.  
- User acceptance testing coordination.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope  
- Manual testing of non-automated components.  
- Testing of external systems not integrated with the project.

## 3. Test Types  
- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components for correctness.  
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that modules interact correctly.  
- **End-to-End Testing:** Validate the complete workflow from JIRA monitoring to release management.  
- **Performance Testing:** Assess the system's responsiveness and throughput under load.  
- **Security Testing:** Verify that security controls are effective and data is protected.

## 4. Test Environment  
- The testing will be conducted in a staging environment that mirrors production.  
- Necessary tools include JIRA, testing frameworks, and monitoring tools.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities  
- **Test Manager:** Oversee testing activities and manage resources.  
- **QA Engineers:** Execute tests and report results.  
- **Developers:** Fix defects identified during testing.

## 6. Schedule  
- Testing phases will align with the development sprints.  
- Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders on testing progress.

## 7. Metrics  
- Defect density (number of defects per function point).  
- Test coverage (percentage of requirements tested).  
- Pass/fail rates for test cases.

## 8. Risks  
- Potential delays in integration with JIRA.  
- Availability of testing resources may impact timelines.

## 9. Entry and Exit Criteria  
### 9.1 Entry Criteria  
- All components must be developed and unit tested.  
- Test environment must be set up and accessible.

### 9.2 Exit Criteria  
- All critical and high-severity defects must be resolved.  
- Test coverage must meet the defined thresholds.
