## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to automate key aspects of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) through the Agentic SDLC Automation Project, enhancing efficiency and oversight in software development processes.

## Objectives  
- Automate JIRA monitoring and requirements analysis.  
- Generate standardized stories and tasks.  
- Create and execute automated tests.  
- Manage user acceptance testing (UAT) and coordinate releases.

## Scope  
The project encompasses the development of a system that integrates with existing JIRA infrastructure, employing AI agents to perform tasks with human oversight. The system will include functionalities for monitoring, analysis, story generation, testing, and release management.

## Stakeholders  
- Development Teams (Engineers, Architects, Technical Leads)  
- Product Managers  
- Project Managers  
- QA Engineers  
- Business Requestors  
- System Administrators

## Constraints  
- Must integrate with existing JIRA instances.  
- Must adhere to organizational security policies.  
- Must maintain audit trails for all automated actions.  
- Must provide override capabilities for human users.  
- Must operate within existing infrastructure constraints.

## Success Metrics  
- Reduction in manual effort for SDLC tasks by 50%.  
- Increase in the accuracy of requirements analysis by 30%.  
- Successful execution of automated tests with a pass rate of 95% or higher.  
- Timely completion of UAT and release management processes.

## Assumptions  
- JIRA API availability and stability.  
- Access to appropriate permissions for JIRA operations.  
- Standardized story templates are defined and available.  
- Testing frameworks are accessible via API.

## Open Questions  
- What specific security policies must be adhered to?  
- Are there any existing tools or frameworks that must be integrated?
