"Document Creation","Real-time Document Creation","As a Project Manager, I want to create a PRD in real-time so that I can capture requirements as they come to mind.","Given I am logged in, when I start a new PRD, then I should see a blank document ready for editing.\nGiven I make changes, when I save the document, then my changes should be saved without delay.\nGiven I am editing, when I invite another user, then they should see my changes in real-time.\nGiven I am editing, when I exceed the character limit for a section, then I should receive a validation error."
"Collaboration Features","User Feedback Collection","As a Project Manager, I want to collect feedback on my PRD so that I can improve the document based on team input.","Given I have shared the PRD, when a user provides feedback, then I should see their feedback in a dedicated section.\nGiven I receive feedback, when I respond to it, then my response should be visible to the user who provided the feedback.\nGiven I have feedback, when I mark it as resolved, then it should be archived from the feedback section.\nGiven I have unresolved feedback, when I view the document, then I should see a notification indicating the number of unresolved feedback items."
"Document Management","Version Control","As a Project Manager, I want to save drafts of my PRD so that I can revert to previous versions if needed.","Given I am editing a PRD, when I save a draft, then a new version should be created.\nGiven I have multiple versions, when I view the version history, then I should see a list of all saved versions with timestamps.\nGiven I select a previous version, when I choose to revert, then the document should reflect the selected version.\nGiven I have reverted to a previous version, when I make new changes, then a new version should be created again."
