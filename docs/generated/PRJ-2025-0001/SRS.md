## 1. Introduction  
### 1.1 Purpose  
This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the Agentic SDLC Automation Project. It serves as the primary reference for the design, development, testing, and implementation of the system.

### 1.2 Scope  
The Agentic SDLC system will automate key aspects of the software development lifecycle, including JIRA monitoring, requirements analysis, story creation, test generation, and release management. The system will employ AI agents to perform these tasks with appropriate human oversight.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **SDLC:** Software Development Life Cycle  
- **JIRA:** Issue tracking and project management software  
- **UAT:** User Acceptance Testing  
- **API:** Application Programming Interface  
- **MVP:** Minimum Viable Product  
- **Agent:** AI component designed to perform specific functions autonomously

### 1.4 References  
- JIRA API Documentation  
- Organizational SDLC Policies  
- Story Template Standards  
- Test Framework Documentation

### 1.5 Overview  
This document is organized into functional requirements, non-functional requirements, system interfaces, and constraints. It will guide the development team in creating a system that meets stakeholder needs while ensuring quality and compliance.

## 2. Overall Description  
### 2.1 Product Perspective  
The Agentic SDLC system will integrate with existing JIRA infrastructure to automate routine aspects of the software development lifecycle. It will operate as a supervisor-agent architecture where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of the process under the coordination of a supervisor agent.

### 2.2 Product Functions  
At a high level, the system will:  
- Monitor JIRA boards for new “To Do” items.  
- Analyze requirements for completeness and clarity.  
- Request clarification from stakeholders when needed.  
- Generate standardized stories and tasks.  
- Create automated tests.  
- Execute tests and report results.  
- Manage user acceptance testing.  
- Coordinate releases.

### 2.3 User Characteristics  
The system will interact with:  
- Development Teams  
- Product Managers  
- Project Managers  
- QA Engineers  
- Business Requestors  
- System Administrators

### 2.4 Constraints  
- Must integrate with existing JIRA instances.  
- Must adhere to organizational security policies.  
- Must maintain audit trails for all automated actions.  
- Must provide override capabilities for human users.  
- Must operate within existing infrastructure constraints.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

- The system SHALL track changes to monitored items.

### 3.2 Requirements Analysis  
- The system SHALL analyze new items against the standard template.  
- The system SHALL identify missing required fields.  
- The system SHALL evaluate the clarity and specificity of requirements.  
- The system SHALL score requirements based on completeness metrics.

### 3.3 Story Generation  
- The system SHALL apply the standard story template to create structured stories.  
- The system SHALL populate template fields from requirement details.  
- The system SHALL generate unique identifiers for created stories.  
- The system SHALL link stories to original requirements.

### 3.4 Testing Framework  
- The system SHALL create automated tests based on acceptance criteria.  
- The system SHALL generate unit, integration, and system test templates.  
- The system SHALL link tests to stories and requirements.

### 3.5 User Acceptance Testing  
- The system SHALL manage the UAT process for completed items.  
- The system SHALL notify appropriate stakeholders of items ready for UAT.  
- The system SHALL capture and track UAT feedback.

### 3.6 Release Management  
- The system SHALL track items eligible for release.  
- The system SHALL group items into logical release packages.  
- The system SHALL generate release notes from completed items.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements  
### 4.1 Performance  
- The system SHALL detect new JIRA items within 5 minutes of creation.  
- The system SHALL complete requirement analysis within 15 minutes.  
- The system SHALL execute test suites within timeframes appropriate to test size.

### 4.2 Security
