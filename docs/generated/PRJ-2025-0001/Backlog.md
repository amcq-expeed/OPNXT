# Backlog for PRD Automation Application

## Epics
### Epic 1: Document Creation
- **Feature 1.1:** Real-time Document Creation
  - **User Story 1.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want to create a PRD in real-time so that I can capture requirements as they come to mind.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given I am logged in, when I start a new PRD, then I should see a blank document ready for editing.
      - Given I make changes, when I save the document, then my changes should be saved without delay.
      - Given I am editing, when I invite another user, then they should see my changes in real-time.
      - Given I am editing, when I exceed the character limit for a section, then I should receive a validation error.

### Epic 2: Collaboration Features
- **Feature 2.1:** User Feedback Collection
  - **User Story 2.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want to collect feedback on my PRD so that I can improve the document based on team input.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given I have shared the PRD, when a user provides feedback, then I should see their feedback in a dedicated section.
      - Given I receive feedback, when I respond to it, then my response should be visible to the user who provided the feedback.
      - Given I have feedback, when I mark it as resolved, then it should be archived from the feedback section.
      - Given I have unresolved feedback, when I view the document, then I should see a notification indicating the number of unresolved feedback items.

### Epic 3: Document Management
- **Feature 3.1:** Version Control
  - **User Story 3.1.1:** As a Project Manager, I want to save drafts of my PRD so that I can revert to previous versions if needed.
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - Given I am editing a PRD, when I save a draft, then a new version should be created.
      - Given I have multiple versions, when I view the version history, then I should see a list of all saved versions with timestamps.
      - Given I select a previous version, when I choose to revert, then the document should reflect the selected version.
      - Given I have reverted to a previous version, when I make new changes, then a new version should be created again.

## Assumptions
- Users will have access to the necessary technology to use the application.
- The application will be developed following industry standards.

## Open Questions
- What specific integrations with other tools are required?
- What types of notifications or alerts should be implemented for user collaboration?
