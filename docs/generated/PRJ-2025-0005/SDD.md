**Approval:** Pending  

### 1. Architecture Overview  
The Healthcare Appointment System will be built using a microservices architecture to allow for scalability and flexibility. Each service will handle specific functionalities such as user management, appointment scheduling, and notifications.

### 2. Modules/Components  
- **User Management Module**: Handles user registration, authentication, and role management.  
- **Appointment Scheduling Module**: Manages appointment bookings, cancellations, and reminders.  
- **Notification Module**: Sends automated reminders via email or SMS.  
- **Data Management Module**: Maintains a secure database of patient information and appointment records.

### 3. Sequence/Flow  
1. User registers on the platform.  
2. User logs in and views available appointment slots.  
3. User books an appointment.  
4. System sends a confirmation and reminder to the user.  
5. User can view or cancel appointments.

### 4. Integrations/APIs  
- Integration with EHR systems for patient data retrieval.  
- Payment processing APIs for handling transactions.

### 5. Data Model

- **Notification Table**: Stores notification preferences and history.

### 6. Error Handling  
The system will implement robust error handling to manage exceptions and provide user-friendly error messages.

### 7. Security  
Data security measures will comply with HIPAA regulations, including encryption of sensitive data and secure access controls.

### 8. Deployment  
The system will be deployed on a cloud platform to ensure scalability and availability.

### Assumptions & Open Questions  
- What specific EHR systems or payment processing services do you anticipate needing to integrate with?  
- How do you plan to manage user training and support once the system is implemented?
