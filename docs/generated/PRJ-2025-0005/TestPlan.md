# Test Plan

## Project Name: Healthcare Appointment System  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-05  
**Author:** AI SDLC Documentation Expert  
**Approval:** Pending  

### 1. Test Objectives  
To ensure the Healthcare Appointment System meets all functional and non-functional requirements as specified in the SRS.

### 2. In/Out of Scope  
- **In Scope**: Functional testing, performance testing, security testing.  
- **Out of Scope**: User training and support documentation.

### 3. Test Types  
- **Unit Testing**: Verify individual components for correctness.  
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure modules work together as expected.  
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validate the complete flow of the application.  
- **Performance Testing**: Assess system performance under load.  
- **Security Testing**: Ensure compliance with HIPAA and data protection standards.

### 4. Environments  
Testing will be conducted in a staging environment that mirrors production settings.

### 5. Roles  
- **Test Manager**: Oversees testing activities.  
- **Test Engineers**: Execute test cases and report defects.  
- **Developers**: Fix defects and assist in testing.

### 6. Schedule  
Testing will commence after the completion of development and will follow the project timeline.

### 7. Metrics  
- Test coverage percentage.  
- Number of defects found in each testing phase.  
- User satisfaction ratings post-testing.

### 8. Risks  
- Potential delays in testing due to integration issues.  
- User acceptance may vary based on training and support.

### 9. Entry/Exit Criteria  
- **Entry Criteria**: All functional requirements must be implemented.  
- **Exit Criteria**: All critical defects must be resolved, and test coverage must meet the defined threshold.

### Assumptions & Open Questions  
- What specific EHR systems or payment processing services do you anticipate needing to integrate with?  
- How do you plan to manage user training and support once the system is implemented?
