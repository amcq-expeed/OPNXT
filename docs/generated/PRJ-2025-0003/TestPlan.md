- Standard: IEEE 829 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 (adapted)
- Generated: 2025-09-24T19:42:11.271527Z

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
Define the objectives, resources, and processes for testing the product.

### 1.2 Scope
Target unit/integration/e2e with coverage >= 80%; add API and UI tests for critical flows.

## 2. Test Items
- Features under test:
- The system SHALL Provide a structured format for documenting test cases.
- The system SHALL Allow users to categorize tests by functionality.
- The system SHALL Include a version control mechanism for test documentation.
- The system SHALL Support collaboration features for multiple users to edit documentation.
- The system SHALL Enable export of documentation in various formats (e.g., PDF, Markdown).
