## 1. Executive Summary

The Orchestrator Agent is the core component of the AI Agentic SDLC Platform, designed to automate and streamline the software development lifecycle documentation process. This BRD defines the business requirements for building an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to deliver consistent, traceable, and high-quality SDLC artifacts.

### Key Business Drivers
- **70% reduction** in documentation time
- **40% improvement** in requirement coverage  
- **Zero critical gaps** in traceability
- **90% stakeholder satisfaction** with documentation quality

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 Current State (AS-IS)

#### Pain Points
1. **Manual Documentation Overhead**
   - 30-40% of project time spent on documentation
   - Inconsistent formats across teams
   - Frequent omissions and gaps

2. **Traceability Challenges**
   - Requirements not linked to test cases
   - Changes not propagated downstream
   - Difficult impact analysis

3. **Knowledge Silos**
   - Documentation scattered across tools
   - No single source of truth
   - Tribal knowledge not captured

#### Current Process Flow
```
[Idea] → [Manual Meetings] → [Word Docs] → [Email Reviews] → [Lost Updates] → [Outdated Docs]
```

### 2.2 Future State (TO-BE)

#### Vision
An intelligent platform where users input ideas and receive complete, consistent, and traceable SDLC documentation through guided AI-assisted workflows.

#### Target Process Flow
```
[Idea] → [AI Interview] → [Auto-Generated Docs] → [Smart Validation] → [Version Control] → [Living Documentation]
```

#### Key Improvements
- **Automated Generation**: AI creates first drafts
- **Intelligent Guidance**: System asks the right questions
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate consistency checks
- **Living Documents**: Auto-updates when requirements change
- **Complete Traceability**: Every requirement traced to implementation
