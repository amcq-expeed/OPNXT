    When deploying to staging
    Then staging config used
    And secrets properly injected
    And no hardcoded values
    
  Scenario: Rolling Updates
    Given new version ready
    When deployment triggered
    Then rolling update begins
    And zero downtime achieved
    And rollback possible
