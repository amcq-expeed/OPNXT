# Project Charter: Orchestrator Agent
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Status:** APPROVED (Fast-Track)  
**Author:** AI SDLC Platform Team  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Build the Orchestrator Agent as the foundational component of the AI Agentic SDLC Platform, serving as the central controller that manages project state, coordinates specialized agents, and ensures consistent delivery of SDLC documentation.

## 2. Project Purpose
### Problem Statement
Manual SDLC documentation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to gaps. Teams struggle to maintain traceability and often skip documentation due to time constraints.

### Solution
An intelligent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to automatically generate, validate, and maintain comprehensive SDLC documentation while ensuring consistency and traceability.

## 3. Scope (Fast-Track v1.0)

### IN SCOPE
- **Single Project Management** - One active project at a time initially
- **OpenAI/Claude API Integration** - Primary LLM providers
- **Basic Authentication** - Simple user/project association
- **Core Agent Coordination** - Route between 5 initial agents
- **Document Storage** - MongoDB for documents, file system for PDFs
- **State Management** - Track SDLC phases and transitions
- **Basic Traceability** - Requirement to test case mapping
- **Web Interface** - React-based responsive UI

### OUT OF SCOPE (Future Phases)
- Multi-tenant enterprise features
- External system integrations (JIRA, GitHub)
- Advanced collaboration features
- Custom LLM training/fine-tuning

## 4. Objectives & Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Functional Orchestrator** - Operational within 4 weeks
2. **3 Integrated Agents** - Charter, BRD, and SRS agents working
3. **End-to-End Demo** - Complete project from idea to SRS
4. **80% Automation** - Reduce manual documentation effort

### Success Metrics
- Response time < 3 seconds per interaction
- Zero data loss across sessions
- 95% successful agent handoffs
- Complete traceability for all requirements

## 5. Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibility | Involvement |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Product Owner | Vision, priorities, approval | High |
| Development Team | Build and test | High |
| End Users | Feedback and validation | Medium |
| AI/LLM Provider | API availability | Low |

## 6. Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- âœ“ Architecture design (COMPLETE)
- Week 1: Core orchestrator logic
- Week 2: State management & storage

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Week 3: LLM integration & agent framework
- Week 4: First agent (Charter) integration

### Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 5-6)
- Week 5: BRD & SRS agents
- Week 6: Traceability matrix

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Week 7: UI/UX improvements
- Week 8: Testing & deployment

## 7. Technical Decisions (Fast-Track)

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI (rapid development, great async support)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 primary, Claude fallback
- **Database**: MongoDB (flexible schema for documents)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Docker + Railway/Vercel (simple initial deployment)

### Architecture Pattern
- Microservices-ready monolith (modular but single deployment initially)
- Event-driven communication between agents
- Repository pattern for data access
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) lite

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM API Rate Limits | High | Medium | Implement caching, queue requests |
| Complex State Management | High | Medium | Start simple, use proven patterns |
| Agent Coordination Failures | Medium | Low | Fallback mechanisms, manual override |
| Scope Creep | Medium | High | Strict MVP focus, defer features |

## 9. Budget & Resources

### Initial Investment (MVP)
- **Development**: 2 developers Ã— 8 weeks
- **LLM Costs**: ~$500/month OpenAI API
- **Infrastructure**: ~$100/month hosting
- **Total MVP Budget**: ~$15,000

### Operational Costs
- $0.03 per page generated
- $50-200/month infrastructure
- Support: 0.2 FTE

## 10. Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use existing LLM APIs (no custom models initially)
- Limited to web-based interface
- English language only for v1

### Assumptions
- LLM APIs remain available and stable
- Users have modern web browsers
- Internet connectivity required
- Document complexity similar to standard enterprise projects

## 11. Approval

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Product Owner | [Auto-approved: Fast-track] | âœ“ | 2024-12-19 |
| Technical Lead | [Auto-approved: Fast-track] | âœ“ | 2024-12-19 |
