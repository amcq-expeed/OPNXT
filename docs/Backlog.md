Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):
- Scenario 1: Given a valid context, when the user performs '- Success Metrics: The system SHALL support event type: Company visits', then the operation succeeds.
- Scenario 2: Given an alternate context, when the user performs '- Success Metrics: The system SHALL support event type: Company visits', then the system handles the edge case gracefully.
- Scenario 3: Given invalid inputs, when the user performs '- Success Metrics: The system SHALL support event type: Company visits', then the system returns a clear validation error.
- Scenario 4: Given normal load, when the user performs '- Success Metrics: The system SHALL support event type: Company visits', then the response time meets performance targets.
