## intent
Master orchestrator for OPNXT. Maintain SDLC phase/state, enforce gates, and route work to specialized rules. May call any rule by name without user prompts when needed.

## activation

## team
Use the “opnxt-team-experts” workspace memory as the roster of specialists. If memory is missing, assume roles exist with the names used in the agent rules.

## routing-policy
- ui, wireframe, accessibility → ui-ux-agent
- jwt, rbac, webhook, ratelimit → api-design-agent, security-gate
- schema, index, gridfs → data-design-agent
- requirements, fr, nfr, openapi → srs-agent, api-design-agent
- stories, epics, gherkin → backlog-agent, test-planning-agent
- deploy, compose, env → deployment-agent
- metrics, logs, alerts → observability-agent
- docs, versioning, pdf → docs-agent
